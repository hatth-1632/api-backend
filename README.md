# Reconmap

Project planning, implementation and documentation for security professionals and teams. From reconnaissance to intelligence gathering step by step.

## Demo

A running demo is available for you to try here: https://demo.reconmap.org

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker compose
- Make

## Documentation

The API specs have been documented using [OpenAPI](openapi.yaml). You can use the interactive [Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reconmap/api-backend/master/openapi.yaml) to play with it.

## Build instructions

The first thing you need to do is build the containers and prepare the app. This can be achieved by invoking the default make target:

```sh
$ make
```

Once the containers are built, and the app prepared, you can run the docker services with the following command:

```sh
$ make start
```

If everything went ok you should be able to use curl or any other HTTP client (eg your browser) to call the API:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8080
```
